# Roundest (Go + GraphQL + React SPA edition)

This one started fun and slowly drove me insane. The hardest part was getting the graphql typegen to work. Apollo devtools were really cool though.

## Things I wanted to do but didn't end up doing

- [x] Reused `PokemonSprite` component
- [x] Rearchitect page components to have shared containers and meaningful loading states
- [ ] Write utils to handle nullability in graphql so I don't need so many `!`'s
  - The options for this suck so I'm not doing it
