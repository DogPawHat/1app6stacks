# 1 App, 5 Stacks

I built the same app in 5 stacks\*. Those stacks are:

- Ruby on Rails: https://roundest-rails.fly.dev/
- Elixir + Phoenix: https://roundest-phoenix.fly.dev/
- Go + GraphQL + React SPA: https://roundest-go.vercel.app/
- OG T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, tRPC, Prisma): https://roundest-t3.vercel.app/
- Next.js RSCs + App Router: https://roundest-rsc.vercel.app/

\* [Ben](youtube.com/@bmdavis419/) wrote all of the Go code and most of the Elixir version
