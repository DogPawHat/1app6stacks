# 1 App, 5 Stacks

I built the same app in 5 stacks\*. Those stacks are:

- Ruby on Rails
- Elixir + Phoenix
- Go + GraphQL + React SPA
- OG T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, tRPC, Prisma)
- Next.js RSCs + App Router

\* [Ben](youtube.com/@bmdavis419/) wrote most of the Go and Elixir versions
